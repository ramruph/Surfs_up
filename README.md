# Surfs_up

## Overview
This analysis was for investors to look at the weather patterns in Oahu, HI from the months June and December. The investors wanted to see if investing in a Surf & Ice Cream shop would be a good idea based on if the shop would be open year long or if the weather would effect the shops availablility and sales. The information is also provided to investors with the flask app that contains data and statistic analysis in JSON format.

## Results
- June had an average temperature of 75˚f through a 7 year average from 2010 to 2017 from 1700 obersvations
- December had an average temperature of 70˚f through a 7 year average from 2010 to 2017 from 1500 obersvations
- December also had a max temperature of 83˚f and June had a max temp of 85˚f 
- December had a lower minimum temperature than June by 11˚ 


## Summary 
The difference between the June and December months are not as drastic as in other parts in the US. The difference between the average temperatures are only 5 degrees and this indicates that surfing should be able to continue year round. Two addintional queries for this analysis would be to get the percipitaion data for both of these months to see if there are more sunny days or more rainy days. Having more rainy days might not influence die hard surfers, but would effect the sales of ice cream from the shop.
